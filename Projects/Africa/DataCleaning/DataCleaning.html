        <div style="text-align:justify">
            <p>
                <h4>Data Sources</h4>
                The data used in this project is sourced from two organizations: <a href='https://data.worldbank.org/indicator'>The World Bank</a> and
                <a href='http://infrastructureafrica.opendataforafrica.org/'>The African Development Bank Group</a>.
                Both organizations offer API access to their data. Most datasets were clean, only requiring data wrangling.
                Since plots have been created using both R and Python, there are multiple data cleaning files, which are available for download at the bottom of this page.
                <br />
                <br />
                The project scope is Sub-Saharan Africa, so data was filtered to include just those 47 countries.
                The map shows the countries colored by their 2016 population to illustrate.

            <p>
                <h4>Data Collection</h4>
                <br />
                <br />
                R - In the R data cleaning file, data is accessed using an R library called
                <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/WDI.pdf'>WDI (World Development Indicators)</a>
                that is a wrapper for the World Bank API. The R data cleaning file (Data_Cleaning.R) includes the following World Bank indicators:
                <strong>GDP Growth, Inflation (measured by the GDP Deflator), Inflation (measured by CPI), Employment</strong> and
                <strong>Vulnerable Employment</strong>. The data was clean, except for a few "outliers" in the inflation data due to hyperinflation.
                The second R data cleaning file (DataExploration_and_Cleaning.R) includes the following World Bank indicator: <strong>Share of GDP on Infrastructure</strong>
                and the <strong>Infrastructure Index</strong> from The African Development Bank Group.
                <br />
                <br />
                Python - For the Python file, data was collected from the World Bank API using the <a href='https://wbdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>wbdata library</a>.
                The indicators included in the Python data cleaning file (get_clean_data.py) are <strong>
                    GDP, GDP Growth, Population, Access to Electricity (%),
                    Access to Internet (%)
                </strong>, and <strong>Cellphone Subscriptions (per 100)</strong>.

            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Data Exploration</h4>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Inflation</strong> can be measured two ways, through the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP Deflator.
                Due to periods of hyperinflation in some African countries, the data has outliers, which are removed for further processing.
                For the CPI, one outlier was removed: Democratic Republic of Congo, 1994 (23,773%). The same process was repeated for the alternate measure of inflation,
                the GDP Deflator, as show in the below plot. The same outlier was removed: Democratic Republic of Congo, 1994 (26,766%).
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src='images/cleaning_cpi.jpeg' style="height: 400px; width: 550px">
                <img src='images/cleaning_gdpd.jpeg' style="height: 400px; width: 550px; float:left">
                <br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the <strong>Employment</strong> and <strong>Vulnerable Employment</strong> data was clean, without any outliers.
                Sub-Saharan Africa has a higher level of employment, but also a higher level of vulnerable employment when compared to the World.
                Additionally, the vulnerable employment data has a wider distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa than for the World.
                <br />

                    <img src='images/cleaning_vulnerable_employment.jpeg' style="height:400px; width:450px; float:right">
                    <img src='images/cleaning_employment.jpeg' style="height: 400px; width: 450px">
                </center>

            </p>

            <p>

                From the below pairplot, there is a positive correlation between <strong>Access to Electricity</strong> to both <strong>Access to Internet</strong>
                and <strong>Cellphone Subscriptions</strong>. Additionally, Population and GDP are correlated.
                Correlation coefficients were also determined to support the visual evidence.
                The distribution of the infrastructure indicators are right-tailed, which indicates some disparity in the availability of those services by country.
                Countries are also grouped throughout this project by their <strong>Income Level</strong>, as designated by the World Bank.
                The data was remapped to include this attribute, and is reflected in the pairplot below and throughout the project.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src='images/cleaning_pairplot.png' style="height: 600px; width: 750px">
                <br />
                <br />
                Indicators are higher for those countries designated as High or Upper middle income, as expected.
                However, running an ANOVA 1-way test shows no significant difference in the infrastructure indicators (electric, internet, cellphones)
                by the country's income level.
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, the data was also checked for missing values and outliers (shown below in the boxplot of 2016 data) range of values.
                Country names were cleaned to strip diacritics. New variables were created to investigate growth rates.
                In sum, this data was clean with very few missing values.
